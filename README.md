# chip-8

### The goal of this project is to learn: 

- Lower level programming concepts.
- The base system: specifically base 2 (binary), base 10 (decimal), base 16 (hexadecimal), how they interact with each other and the concept of abstract numbers in programming
- Bits, nibbles, bytes, ASCII encoding, and big and little endian values
- Bitwise operators - AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), left shift (<<), right shift (>>) and how to use them for masking, setting, and testing values
- Using the Node built-in file system (fs)
- The concept of a raw data buffer and how to work with it, how to convert an 8-bit buffer to a 16-bit big endian array
- Writing and understanding a 8-bit and 16-bit hex dump
- How to disassemble and decode an opcode into instructions a CPU can use
- How a CPU can utilize memory, stack, program counters, stack pointers, memory addresses, and registers
- How a CPU implements fetch, decode, and execute
